### **Frontend (React) Docker Setup**

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Ensure all necessary files are created:**
   - `Dockerfile` (for React project)
   - `.dockerignore`
   - `docker-compose.yml` (optional but recommended)

2. **Build and Run the Frontend with Docker:**

   From the root directory of your React project, run the following commands:

   1. **Build the Docker image:**

      ```bash
      docker build -t react-app .
      ```

   2. **Run the container:**

      You can run the container with the following command:

      ```bash
      docker run -p 3000:3000 react-app
      ```

      This command exposes port 3000 of your container to port 3000 on your machine. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the React app.

   **Alternatively**, if you're using Docker Compose:

   1. **Run using Docker Compose:**

      ```bash
      docker-compose up --build
      ```

      This will build and start the container as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. By default, your frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
